# Christopher Watson's Portfolio
## Introduction
Thank you for spending the time viewing my work portfolio!   
   
This work portfolio displays some of my most recent work and class projects. This repository will also include any independent work. I am building this portfolio to begin my career in cyber security. I plan to include this in my resume as I search for a position in cloud networking or network administration. I plan to gain the skills to begin working in a pen-testing position. My most recent experience comes from the University of Davis - Extension Cyber Security Bootcamp. This intensive 24-week course has given me the skill to feel confident in this new field. This page will grow as my skills and experience grow!
   
   
   ## Goals
   - In February I plan to take my Network+ Exam
   - Finish my Python coding class
   - Research and begin a Pen-Testing Training course
