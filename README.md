# Christopher Watson's Portfolio
## Introduction
Thank you for spending the time viewing my work portfolio!   
   
This work portfolio displays some of my most recent work and class projects. This repository will also include any independent work. I am building this portfolio to begin my career in cyber security. I plan to include this in my resume as I search for a position in cloud networking or network administration. I plan to gain the skills to begin working in a pen-testing position. My most recent experience comes from the University of Davis - Extension Cyber Security Bootcamp. This intensive 24-week course has given me the skill to feel confident in this new field. This page will grow as my skills and experience grow!
   
   
   ## Goals
   - I plan to take my Security+ Exam in March
   - Finish my Python coding class
   - Research and begin a Pen-Testing Training course
   - Begin applying to Network Admin or SOC Analyst positions
      
     
## Most Recent Work

I just finished up my [Red vs. Blue Project](https://github.com/ChCWatson/Portfolio/blob/main/UC-Davis%20Extension%20Cyber%20Security%20Bootcamp/Red%20Vs.%20Blue%20Project/Chris%20Watson%20Red%20vs%20Blue%20Project.pdf). This allowed me to take the role of a SOC Analyst and Pentester.

[UC-Davis Elk-Stack-Project]()

In this project I configure an ELK stack server in order to set up a cloud monitoring system. This project will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate my knowledge of cloud, network security, logging and monitoring.

Tasks

Deploy containers using Ansible and Docker.
Deploy Filebeat and Metricbeat using Ansible.
Deploy the ELK stack on a server.
Diagram networks and creating a README.
